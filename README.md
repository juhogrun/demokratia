Combat UI mod that includes all the essential tools a PUG group needs in a Mythic+ dungeon. Includes a robust stop, silence and interrupt sequencer that can replace a group secretary staring at OmniCD timers and yelling to others what he sees.

Hooks into setting the focus target and shows an interrupt list for that target, allowing coordinating multiple kicks on multiple targets without any other setup than installing the WeakAura.

Requires libOpenRaid and Details! Framework, both of which you have simply by using Details! Damage Meter.
